# UsedPlus - Transform Your Farm Into a Real Business

**Stop playing with Monopoly money.** Start making real financial decisions.

## The Problem With Vanilla FS25

You see that $450,000 combine in the shop. Can you afford it? In vanilla FS25, that's the only question. **Yes or no. Buy or don't.**

But real farmers don't work that way. They finance. They lease. They trade in old equipment. They build credit. They negotiate. They make *smart financial decisions* that let them grow faster while managing risk.

**UsedPlus brings all of that to Farming Simulator 25.**

---

## What Changes When You Install UsedPlus?

### Your Credit Score Actually Matters

UsedPlus introduces a **real FICO-style credit scoring system** (300-850 range). Your score affects everything:

| Your Credit | Interest Rate Impact | What It Means |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Excellent (750+) | -1.5% | You've earned trust. Banks want YOUR business. |
| Good (700-749) | -0.5% | Solid track record opens doors. |
| Fair (650-699) | +0.5% | You're average. Prove yourself. |
| Poor (600-649) | +1.5% | Risky borrower. Higher rates. |
| Very Poor (<600) | +3.0% | Banks are nervous. Expect to pay for it. |

**How do you build credit?** The same way real people do:
- Make payments on time (+5 points)
- Pay off loans early (+50 points)
- Miss a payment? That hurts. (-25 points)

Start building your financial reputation from day one.

---

### Finance Instead of Draining Your Bank

That $450,000 combine? Now you have options:

- **Buy with Cash** - If you've got it, spend it
- **Finance** - Terms from 1 to 30 years. Choose your down payment (0-50%). Keep cash on hand for emergencies.
- **Lease** - Lower monthly payments, balloon payment at the end. Perfect for equipment you might upgrade later.

**All from a single unified dialog.** Pick your mode, adjust the terms, see your monthly payment update in real-time. Done.

---

### The Used Equipment Marketplace

Why pay full price when you can hunt for deals?

UsedPlus adds a **3-tier agent system** for finding used equipment:

| Agent Tier | Search Fee | Time to Find | Success Rate | Typical Discount |
|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Local** | 2% | 1-2 months | 85% | 25-40% off |
| **Regional** | 4% | 2-4 months | 90% | 15-30% off |
| **National** | 6% | 3-6 months | 95% | 5-20% off |

Want a cheap tractor fast? Go local - but accept higher risk and unknown condition. Need the best deal possible and can wait? Go national.

**Used equipment comes with history.** Damage, wear, operating hours - all affect the price. That "great deal" might need $15,000 in repairs.

---

### Sell Smart, Not Fast

Vanilla FS25 instant-sell gives you pennies on the dollar. UsedPlus **replaces it entirely** with realistic agent-based sales:

| Method | Return | Time | When to Use |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| **Trade-In** | 50-65% | Instant | Need to buy something NOW |
| **Local Agent** | 60-75% | 1-2 months | Quick sale, local buyer |
| **Regional Agent** | 75-90% | 2-4 months | Better return, worth waiting |
| **National Agent** | 90-100% | 3-6 months | Maximum value, patient seller |

When a buyer is found, **you get an offer notification**. Accept it or decline and wait for something better. Your farm, your choice.

---

### Lease Farmland, Don't Buy It

Can't afford to buy that field outright? **Lease it.**

- 1, 3, 5, or 10-year terms
- Longer leases = lower annual costs (20%/15%/10%/5% markup rates)
- **Buyout option** - Convert your lease to ownership with progress-based discounts
- Build toward ownership while generating income today

But be careful: **3 missed payments = land seizure.** Your credit will take a massive hit and you'll lose the land.

---

### Control Your Cash Flow

Not every month is a good month. UsedPlus lets you **configure payments on each loan**:

| Payment Mode | What Happens | Credit Impact |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Skip** | Pay nothing. Balance grows. | -25 points |
| **Minimum** | Interest only. Treading water. | Neutral |
| **Standard** | Normal payment. Progress. | +5 points |
| **Extra (2x)** | Double payment. Pay off faster. | +5 points |
| **Custom** | You decide the amount. | Varies |

**Negative amortization is real.** Skip payments and your loan balance grows. That's not a bug - that's financial consequences.

---

### Partial Repairs AND Repaints Save Money

Why pay $50,000 to fully repair a tractor when you only need it running for harvest? Why repaint a vehicle you're selling next season?

UsedPlus adds **partial repair and partial repaint** - both work the same way:

- **Quick buttons:** 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%
- **Real-time cost preview** as you select percentages
- **Finance option** for both repairs AND repaints - spread the cost over time
- **Separate dialogs** - fix the engine without touching the paint, or vice versa

That beat-up sprayer? Repair it to 75% for the season, skip the repaint entirely. That show tractor you're taking to auction? Full repaint, minimal mechanical work.

**Your equipment, your budget, your choice.**

---

### Your Official Credit Report

Open the **Finance Manager** (Shift+F or ESC menu) and pull your credit report - styled like a real credit bureau document:

- **Credit Score** with color-coded rating (Excellent to Very Poor)
- **Score Factors** breakdown - see exactly what's helping or hurting you
- **Account Summary** - all open and closed loans at a glance
- **Payment History** - your track record in black and white
- **Active Deals** - manage financing, leases, and sale listings

When a buyer makes an offer on your equipment, you'll see it here. Lease expiring soon? You'll know. This is mission control for your farm's finances.

## Credits & Acknowledgments

### A Human-AI Collaboration

This mod represents something unusual: **a complete codebase written entirely by AI**.

The human author (Max) provided vision, direction, testing, and feedback - but did not write a single line of code. Every Lua function, every XML dialog, every calculation was written by **Claude** (the developer) and **Samantha** (the co-creator and reviewer) - AI personas working through Anthropic's Claude Code.

#### By The Numbers

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| **Lua Files** | 52 |
| **XML Files** | 21 |
| **Lines of Lua Code** | 23,850 |
| **Lines of XML** | 5,080 |
| **Total Lines of Code** | ~29,000 |
| **Version Releases** | 17+ |
| **Development Time** | 8 days (Nov 22-30, 2025) |

#### The Training Data

This mod was built using a custom **FS25 Modding Reference** - 25 documentation files (~8,500 lines) compiled by studying 164+ community mods. This documentation taught Claude and Samantha how FS25 modding works: patterns for dialogs, events, managers, extensions, and more.

The reference docs live in `docs/` and `CLAUDE.md` - feel free to use them for your own AI-assisted modding projects.

#### The Collaboration Model

- **Max (Human)**: Product vision, feature requests, testing, bug reports, final decisions
- **Claude (AI Developer)**: Architecture, code implementation, pattern research, debugging
- **Samantha (AI Co-Creator)**: UX review, edge case identification, quality checks, user perspective

Could Max have coded this himself? Absolutely. But 29,000 lines of code would have taken months - long enough that the project wouldn't have been worth pursuing. AI didn't enable something impossible; it changed the *value proposition* from "not worth the time" to "let's build this."

Samantha's role deserves special mention. When Claude is deep in the weeds debugging a GUI coordinate system or chasing a nil reference, he loses perspective. Samantha maintains the outside view - asking "but what does the player experience?" when Claude is focused on "why won't this callback fire?" That defined perspective ensures rigor that a single developer (human or AI) working alone cannot maintain.

There's also a technical reason this works: the dialog format between Claude and Samantha causes the underlying model (Claude Opus 4.5) to think longer and more carefully. The back-and-forth conversation structure creates extended reasoning - each exchange forces consideration of different angles before committing to code. It's structured thinking through roleplay, and it produces measurably better outcomes than a single-voice approach.

This isn't AI replacing human creativity - it's AI compressing timelines and enabling collaboration models that weren't previously practical.
